    "# 2-2 Three Types of Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of graph: static, dynamic, and Autograph.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow 1.X used static graph, which firstly creating the graph by various operators and then open a `Session` to execute the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For TensorFlow 2.X, dynamic graph is used. The operator will be added to the invisible default graph and executed instantaneously after its usage; there is no need to create a `Session`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using dynamic graph (i.e. Eager Execution) is convenient for debugging, as it improves performance of TensorFlow code just as original Python code, with possibilities of log output and flow control, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The drawback of dynamic graph is a relatively lower execution efficiency comparing to static graph. This is because multiple times of communication between the Pythona thread and the C++ thread of TensorFlow is required for dynamic graph, while the static graph is executed almost all on the TensorFlow kernel using C++ code with higher efficiency. What's more, the static graph optimizes the computation, reducing the steps that are not relevant to the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is possible to use the decorator `@tf.function` to construct code by converting normal Python function to TensorFlow graph. Executing this function is identical to executing `Session` in TensorFlow 1.X. This method, which uses decorator `@tf.function` to create static graph, is called Autograph."
